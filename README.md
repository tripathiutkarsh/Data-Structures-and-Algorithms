# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
I always struggled to understand these concepts. An even bigger challenge for me is to remember all the different possibilities a problem can be solved in. This is my attempt at building up some "easy to remember" notes to brush up on Data Structures and Algorithms.

I hope that whosoever comes across this repository can benefit from it.
